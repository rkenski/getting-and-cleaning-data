Most of the variables in the tidy data set follow the naming of variables in the original data. They were just summarized and reorganized. A full explanation of them can be found in the “features_info.txt” file that can  be downloaded at:

The difference is just that the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. For each measurement, it is provided:
- An identification of the subject
- Identification of the activity he was performing.
- Mean and standard deviation from triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Mean and standard deviation from triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

The data cleaning process, as done by the “run_analysis.R” file, follows these steps:
-	Download and unizp the files
-	Merge "train" and "test" files and label columns
-	Include activity labels in the data frame
-	Include subject information in the data frame
-	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-	Creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
-	Relabels activities and organizes table

Assumptions on the analysis: 
-	The data includes the variables on the weighted average of the frequency components (“meanFreq”()). Although a separate dimension of measurement, it is still a mean.
-	It does not include, however, the angle vectors (angle()), for not being directly related to the measurements.
